## 1. Project Overview & Context
This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA) Kiosk System** designed for adults with developmental disabilities at a day care center.
* **Goal**: Allows users to select their nickname, view items, order snacks using virtual/allocated credits.
* **Aesthetics & Accessibility**: Focuses on large touch areas, speech guidance (TTS), coin/token visuals instead of dry numbers, and strong sensory feedback (haptic vibrations, audio synthesis).
* **Role Types**:
  1. **User (Kiosk)**: Regular users selecting snacks with their credits.
  2. **Admin**: Staff managing orders, updating credits/stocks, toggling sale status, and viewing logs.
  3. **Board (전광판)**: Large screen dashboard to display order preparation status ("Preparing" / "Ready") with sound alerts and TTS announcements.
  4. **Guest**: Visitors/trial users who get a base amount of virtual credits to test the kiosk flow.

## 2. Technical Stack
* **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 (curated custom properties system in `css/style.css`), Vanilla JavaScript. No TailwindCSS, React, or other thick frameworks.
* **Backend**: **Google Apps Script (GAS) Web App** serves as the API gateway and backend controller. 
  - Backend database: **Google Sheets** (contains sheets: `이용자목록`, `간식목록`, `주문내역`, `관리자로그`, `운영설정`, `후기내역`).
  - Access control: API requests containing state modifications (under `ADMIN_ACTIONS`) are protected by an `ADMIN_TOKEN` verification.
* **Offline & PWA Capabilities**: Service Worker (`service-worker.js`) intercepts requests and caches static resources. 4 distinct PWA manifests exist for each mode to support individual standalone installations.

## 5. Recent Core Modifications & Fixes

### 1) Guest Reviews Inline Expansion (Fix)
* **Issue**: In `guest.html`, clicking the "Show More Reviews" (`#btn-more-reviews`) button caused a redirect to `board.html` (Display Board).
* **Resolution**:
  - Rewrote the review loading and display logic inside [guest.html](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/guest.html).
  - Toggled reviews visibility inline via the state variables `allReviews`, `showingAllReviews` (initial load limit of `3` reviews).
  - Wired the click listener on `#btn-more-reviews` to block default actions (`e.preventDefault()`) and stop event propagation (`e.stopPropagation()`).
  - Since propagation is stopped (preventing the global `body` click listener from firing), we manually trigger click sound/vibrations via `AppState.playClickSound()` and `AppState.vibrate(40)`.
  - Button toggles between "❤️ 후기 더보기" and "❤️ 후기 접기" dynamically depending on state. It hides automatically if the total review count is 3 or less.

### 2) Multi-PWA Installations
* Unique application scope and ids are mapped via:
  - [manifest-kiosk.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-kiosk.json)
  - [manifest-admin.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-admin.json)
  - [manifest-board.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-board.json)
  - [manifest-guest.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-guest.json)

### 3) Guest Nickname & Delivery Place Enhancements
* **Random Nickname Generation**:
  - Automatically populates the guest nickname input (`guest.html`) using a random combination rule: `Adjective + 삼각지 + Noun` (e.g. "행복한 삼각지 토끼").
  - Includes an 8% chance to roll a special character nickname: `Adjective + Special Character` (Special characters: "해냄이", "쭉쭉이", "여비").
  - Preserves the nickname across browser reloads using `localStorage` ('guestNickname'), with automatic sync when customized.
  - Blocks ordering if nickname input is empty and displays "닉네임을 입력해 주세요.".
* **Delivery Place Inputs & UI Toggles**:
  - In `confirm.html`, toggles the delivery location input block based on pickup/delivery selection.
  - Pulls default delivery place configuration from Google Sheets settings database (`guestDefaultDeliveryPlace` key, defaulting to "사무실 원탁").
  - Disallows order submissions on blank delivery place inputs.
* **Delivery Location Tracking**:
  - Appends the delivery location into Column P (`deliveryPlace`) of the orders table.
  - Renders the delivery location across order completion tracking page (`complete.html`), guest order history lookup (`guest-orders.html`), and admin boards (`admin.html`).

### 4) Production Readiness & Deployment
* **API Configuration**:
  - Reverted `USE_MOCK = false` in `js/config.js` to ensure the project communicates with the live Google Sheets backend.
* **Google Apps Script Requirement**:
  - The `deliveryPlace` column (Column P) support has been added to the backend. The latest `Code.gs` from `google-apps-script.md` must be copied to the Google Apps Script editor and deployed as a **New Deployment** for the changes to take effect in production.

### 5) "Today's Delivery Team" & Rebranding
* **Guest UI Welcome Messaging & Brand Reorientation**:
  - Pivoted away from "vocational training / mock experience" terminology to a realistic "delivery service" model.
  - Welcome text, name prompts, and credit labels have been updated on `guest.html`:
    - "직업체험 배달 서비스" -> "삼각지 카페 배달 서비스"
    - "체험하실 이름을 적어주세요" -> "주문하실 이름을 적어주세요"
    - "가상 크레딧 10개 무료 지급" -> "신규 방문 크레딧 10개 지급"
* **Operational Control of Today's Delivery Team**:
  - Added a dashboard control panel under `admin.html` to configure:
    - Team visibility toggle, Title (e.g. "📦 오늘의 배달팀"), Members (e.g. "김○○|배달 담당, 박○○|상품 준비 담당"), and Team message.
  - Dynamically renders the delivery team info on the Guest home screen when enabled.
  - Data mapping is dynamically handled using the pre-existing sheet key-value structure under `운영설정` (Settings) tab.

### 6) Code Review Improvements (Latest)
* **GAS Archiving Performance Optimization**:
  - Heavily optimized `archiveOldOrders` in [google-apps-script.md](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/google-apps-script.md). Replaced the sequential `deleteRow()` and `appendRow()` looping logic (which triggered network timeouts in Google Apps Script when processing multiple history items) with memory-side filtering and a single bulk-write (`setValues`) operation.
* **Admin Refresh Pause on Editing**:
  - Added a global `isModalOpen` state flag in `admin.html` to temporarily pause the 30-second auto-refresh timer when administrative modals are open. 
  - Prevents form data loss and modal closure while editing user credits or snack details. Re-initiates the countdown immediately once modals are dismissed.
* **PWA Service Worker Cache Busting**:
  - Bumped the service worker version in [service-worker.js](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/service-worker.js) to `kiosk-cache-v46` to force-update client browsers and bypass stale local HTML caches.

### 7) Guest Double-Order Prevention & Cache Issue Resolution
* **Guest Double-Order Prevention**:
  - Implemented client-side detection in `guest.html`: Checks `localStorage` (`guestOrders`) for active orders matching today's date (formatted as `YYYY-M-D`). Shows a warning notice if an active order exists.
  - Implemented server-side check in `placeOrder` (GAS): Uses `guestDeviceId` to scan the active orders list and blocks new orders if there is an active order for the same day.
* **Cache/Past Orders Limit Fix**:
  - Solved issues where cached orders from previous days blocked today's orders.
  - Strictly limited the active order check to the current date (`isSameKoreaDate` on server, local date string comparison on client), ensuring yesterday's or past cached orders do not restrict new orders.

### 8) Guest Review Photo Upload & Admin Photo Moderation
* **GAS Permission Bug Fix**:
  - Removed `uploadImage` from the global `ADMIN_ACTIONS` block (which strictly required an admin token).
  - Moved token validation inside `uploadImage` to run only when `type` is `'user'` or `'snack'`, permitting guest review photo uploads (`type === 'review'`) without credentials.
* **Frontend Error Handlers**:
  - Added user-facing confirm dialog popups for image upload errors in `complete.html` and `guest-orders.html` to prevent silent upload failures.
* **Admin Layout & Moderation Panel**:
  - Redesigned image input layout in `admin.html` (for both add and edit modals) by stacking text URL fields and file selection buttons vertically, resolving the squished oval layout bug.
  - Added a "후기 사진" (Review Photo) column in the admin reviews management table in `admin.html`, letting administrators inspect thumbnails and click to open full-resolution images.
* **Guest Review Scroll Optimizations**:
  - Expanded `.review-list` scroll container max-height in `guest.html` from `320px` to `520px` to display photo cards comfortably.
  - Integrated momentum scrolling (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`) and custom styled scrollbars for a modern mobile feel.

### 9) Dashboard Separation & Admin Stability Improvements (Latest)
* **Administrative Dashboard Full Separation**:
  - Extracted the live order board from `admin.html` into a dedicated `kitchen.html` (오늘 주문 운영).
  - Extracted the review moderation board into a dedicated `reviews.html` (후기 관리 화면).
  - `admin.html` (주간매점 관리자 설정) now only handles foundational data like users and snacks.
* **Performance & Stability Optimization**:
  - Fully isolated API calls for each specialized file to prevent freezing: `admin.html` no longer fetches orders or reviews, `kitchen.html` no longer fetches snacks or reviews, etc.
  - Hardened JavaScript execution by adding `null` existence checks (`if (document.getElementById(...))`) before binding `addEventListener` across all admin-facing files, preventing runtime crashes when specific UI panels are absent.
  - Added header navigation buttons across `admin.html`, `kitchen.html`, and `reviews.html` to allow seamless switching between administrative views.
* **Guest Review Viewer Modal**:
  - Added a mobile-optimized modal to `guest.html` that allows guests to click on recent reviews to see them in a larger view.
  - Displays full-resolution photos without cropping, along with messages, tags, and stamps.
  - Includes "Previous" and "Next" navigation buttons to seamlessly browse through all loaded reviews without closing the modal.
  - Stripped out admin-only features (e.g., visibility toggles) to serve as a pure viewer for guests.

## 6. Implementation Notes & Cautions

* **API Calls & Mocks**: While developing locally, you can switch between mock database and live spreadsheet database in [js/config.js](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/js/config.js) using the `USE_MOCK` boolean value.
* **Touch Jitter (Double-Click Prevention)**: Users with motor control challenges might trigger duplicate clicks. Use `AppState.bindCardTap(el, callback)` instead of standard click handlers for critical buttons in user-facing views to check coordinates delta and timing.
* **Haptic Feedbacks**: Sounds are created using the Web Audio API synthesizer dynamically. Do not rely on external MP3 files for general interaction sounds.
* **Google Apps Script Deployments**: If you modify the backend API routes or settings, copy code from [google-apps-script.md](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/google-apps-script.md) into the Google Sheet Script Editor, save, and trigger **[New Deployment]** (Web App, executing as Me, accessible by Anyone). Update `API_URL` in [js/config.js](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/js/config.js) to match the new address.
