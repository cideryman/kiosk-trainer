# Kiosk Project Handoff Document (For AI Agents)

This document is compiled for AI agents (like Antigravity) to easily grasp the project context, technical architecture, recent updates, and continue working on this repository seamlessly across different environments.

## 1. Project Overview & Context
This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA) Kiosk System** designed for adults with developmental disabilities at a day care center.
* **Goal**: Allows users to select their nickname, view items, order snacks using virtual/allocated credits.
* **Aesthetics & Accessibility**: Focuses on large touch areas, speech guidance (TTS), coin/token visuals instead of dry numbers, and strong sensory feedback (haptic vibrations, audio synthesis).
* **Role Types**:
  1. **User (Kiosk)**: Regular users selecting snacks with their credits.
  2. **Admin**: Staff managing orders, updating credits/stocks, toggling sale status, and viewing logs.
  3. **Board (전광판)**: Large screen dashboard to display order preparation status ("Preparing" / "Ready") with sound alerts and TTS announcements.
  4. **Guest**: Visitors/trial users who get a base amount of virtual credits to test the kiosk flow.

## 2. Technical Stack
* **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 (curated custom properties system in `css/style.css`), Vanilla JavaScript. No TailwindCSS, React, or other thick frameworks.
* **Backend**: **Google Apps Script (GAS) Web App** serves as the API gateway and backend controller. 
  - Backend database: **Google Sheets** (contains sheets: `이용자목록`, `간식목록`, `주문내역`, `관리자로그`, `운영설정`, `후기내역`).
  - Access control: API requests containing state modifications (under `ADMIN_ACTIONS`) are protected by an `ADMIN_TOKEN` verification.
* **Offline & PWA Capabilities**: Service Worker (`service-worker.js`) intercepts requests and caches static resources. 4 distinct PWA manifests exist for each mode to support individual standalone installations.

## 4. Database Schema (Google Sheets)
* **`이용자목록` (Users)**: `userId` (ID), `nickname` (Name/Alias), `credit` (Balance), `useYn` (Active flag: Y/N), `imageUrl` (User Photo ID or URL).
* **`간식목록` (Snacks)**: `snackId` (ID), `name` (Name), `point` (Cost), `imageUrl` (Image), `saleYn` (Availability flag: Y/N), `stock` (Inventory, 0 = Sold Out), `displayOrder` (Order in list), `target` (user/guest/both).
* **`주문내역` (Orders)**: `timestamp`, `orderNo` (ID), `userId`, `nickname`, `snackId`, `snackName`, `quantity`, `point` (Cost), `servedYn` (Served status: N/P/R/Y), `cancelTimestamp`, `orderToken`, `deliveryType` (pickup/delivery), `deliveryFee`, `totalCredit`, `reviewed` (Boolean), `deliveryPlace` (Delivery location, Column P).
* **`관리자로그` (Admin Logs)**: Tracks modifications made by administrative accounts for audit.
* **`운영설정` (System Settings)**: System operational metadata.
  - Added `guestDefaultDeliveryPlace` key mapping (defaults to "사무실 원탁") for the guest delivery place defaults.
* **`후기내역` (Reviews)**: Customer reviews / compliments.

## 5. Recent Core Modifications & Fixes

### 1) Guest Reviews Inline Expansion (Fix)
* **Issue**: In `guest.html`, clicking the "Show More Reviews" (`#btn-more-reviews`) button caused a redirect to `board.html` (Display Board).
* **Resolution**:
  - Rewrote the review loading and display logic inside [guest.html](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/guest.html).
  - Toggled reviews visibility inline via the state variables `allReviews`, `showingAllReviews` (initial load limit of `3` reviews).
  - Wired the click listener on `#btn-more-reviews` to block default actions (`e.preventDefault()`) and stop event propagation (`e.stopPropagation()`).
  - Since propagation is stopped (preventing the global `body` click listener from firing), we manually trigger click sound/vibrations via `AppState.playClickSound()` and `AppState.vibrate(40)`.
  - Button toggles between "❤️ 후기 더보기" and "❤️ 후기 접기" dynamically depending on state. It hides automatically if the total review count is 3 or less.

### 2) Multi-PWA Installations
* Unique application scope and ids are mapped via:
  - [manifest-kiosk.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-kiosk.json)
  - [manifest-admin.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-admin.json)
  - [manifest-board.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-board.json)
  - [manifest-guest.json](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/manifest-guest.json)

### 3) Guest Nickname & Delivery Place Enhancements
* **Random Nickname Generation**:
  - Automatically populates the guest nickname input (`guest.html`) using a random combination rule: `Adjective + 삼각지 + Noun` (e.g. "행복한 삼각지 토끼").
  - Includes an 8% chance to roll a special character nickname: `Adjective + Special Character` (Special characters: "해냄이", "쭉쭉이", "여비").
  - Preserves the nickname across browser reloads using `localStorage` ('guestNickname'), with automatic sync when customized.
  - Blocks ordering if nickname input is empty and displays "닉네임을 입력해 주세요.".
* **Delivery Place Inputs & UI Toggles**:
  - In `confirm.html`, toggles the delivery location input block based on pickup/delivery selection.
  - Pulls default delivery place configuration from Google Sheets settings database (`guestDefaultDeliveryPlace` key, defaulting to "사무실 원탁").
  - Disallows order submissions on blank delivery place inputs.
* **Delivery Location Tracking**:
  - Appends the delivery location into Column P (`deliveryPlace`) of the orders table.
  - Renders the delivery location across order completion tracking page (`complete.html`), guest order history lookup (`guest-orders.html`), and admin boards (`admin.html`).

## 6. Implementation Notes & Cautions

* **API Calls & Mocks**: While developing locally, you can switch between mock database and live spreadsheet database in [js/config.js](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/js/config.js) using the `USE_MOCK` boolean value.
* **Touch Jitter (Double-Click Prevention)**: Users with motor control challenges might trigger duplicate clicks. Use `AppState.bindCardTap(el, callback)` instead of standard click handlers for critical buttons in user-facing views to check coordinates delta and timing.
* **Haptic Feedbacks**: Sounds are created using the Web Audio API synthesizer dynamically. Do not rely on external MP3 files for general interaction sounds.
* **Google Apps Script Deployments**: If you modify the backend API routes or settings, copy code from [google-apps-script.md](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/google-apps-script.md) into the Google Sheet Script Editor, save, and trigger **[New Deployment]** (Web App, executing as Me, accessible by Anyone). Update `API_URL` in [js/config.js](file:///c:/Users/user/Desktop/키오스크/js/config.js) to match the new address.
